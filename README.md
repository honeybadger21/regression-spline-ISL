Moving beyond Linear Regression and using Polynomial Regression, Step Functions, and Regression Splines to fit 'Wage vs Age'

Although linear models are relatively simple to describe and implement, the standard linear regression has significant limitaions in terms of predictive power. This is primarily because the linear assumption is almost always an approximation, and sometimes a poor one. If we want to relax the linearity assumption but still maintain the linearity assumption, then we can do this by examining very simple extensions of linear models like polynomial regression and step functions, as well as more sophisticated approaches such as splines, local regression, and generalized additive models. Let's dive into interesting methods for regression by following along Chapter 7 from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning".

Here, we will be working with Polynomial Regression, Step Functions and Regression Splines to discover the relationship between wage and age.
